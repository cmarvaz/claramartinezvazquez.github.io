We identified and characterized the largest (536) RR Lyrae (RRL) sample in a Milky Way dSph satellite (Sculptor) based on optical photometry data collected over ∼24 years. The RRLs display a spread in V-magnitude (∼0.35 mag) which appears larger than photometric errors and the horizontal branch (HB) luminosity evolution of a mono-metallic population. Using several calibrations of two different reddening free and metal independent period–Wesenheit relations we provide a new distance estimate μ = 19.62 mag (σμ = 0.04 mag) that agrees well with literature estimates. We constrained the metallicity distribution of the old population, using the MI period–luminosity relation, and we found that it ranges from −2.3 to −1.5 dex. The current estimate is narrower than suggested by low and intermediate spectroscopy of RGBs (Δ [Fe/H]≤ 1.5). We also investigated the HB morphology as a function of the galactocentric distance. The HB in the innermost regions is dominated by red HB stars and by RRLs, consistent with a more metal-rich population, while in the outermost regions it is dominated by blue HB stars and RRLs typical of a metal-poor population. Our results suggest that fast chemical evolution occurred in Sculptor, and that the radial gradients were in place at an early epoch.
