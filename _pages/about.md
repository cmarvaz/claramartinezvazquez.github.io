I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO), a division of the NSFâ€™s National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory (NOIR Lab). My main scientific interest are in stellar population, galaxy formation and evolution, and time domain astronomy -specially in the study of pulsating variable stars (such as RR Lyrae, Cepheids, delta Scuti) in Local Group dwarf galaxies.

I am a member of several international collaborations: DES ([Dark Energy Survey](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/)), DELVE (the DECam Local Volume Exploration survey), ISLAndS (for Initial Star formation and Lifetimes of Andromeda Satellites). I am also involved in smaller (but not less important) international collaborations foused on galactic-archeology and on the study and characterization of variable stars in the Local Group galaxies and stellar clusters.

Since October 2017 up until the date, I am part of the Scientific Support Team of the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) at the Blanco 4m telescope and I am continuing my research focusing, in particular, on the use of variable stars as standard candles and as probes of the evolution of Local Group galaxies.
