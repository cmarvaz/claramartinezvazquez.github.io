My research interests are primarily focused on the use of variable stars as stellar population tracers to study the formation and evolution of dwarf galaxies in the Local Group and also to understand the formation of our own galaxy, the Milky Way. 

To the date I have been involved in several projects that search for variable stars in many Local Group dwarf galaxies and outer halo globular clusters located in different environments:
* Sculptor ([Martínez-Vázquez et al. 2016b](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.462.4349M/abstract))

* And VI, NGC 185, NGC 147 ([Monelli et al. 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...842...60M/abstract))

* NGC 5824 ([Walker, Andreuzzi, Martínez-Vázquez et al. 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AJ....154....8W/abstract))

* And I, II, III, XV, XVI, XXVIII ([Martínez-Vázquez et al. 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...850..137M/abstract))

* Crater II ([Monelli, Walker, Martínez-Vázquez et al. 2018](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.479.4279M/abstract), [Vivas, Walker, Martínez-Vázquez et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492.1061V/abstract))

* Grus I, Kim 2, Phoenix II, Grus II ([Martínez-Vázquez et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.490.2183M/abstract))

* Several ultra-faint dwarfs ([Vivas, Martínez-Vázquez & Walker, 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492.1061V/abstract)) 

* NGC 419 ([Martínez-Vázquez, Salinas & Vivas, 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv201002220M/abstract))



Below I summarize my main research topics.


# RR Lyrae as distance indicators
Since RR Lyrae stars are radial pulsating variable stars, they obey well-defined period luminosity and period-color relations that provide accurate and precise individual distances. I have used them to obtain accurate distances to several dwarf galaxies. This table lists the distances I have obtained using RR Lyrae stars.

# RR Lyrae as stellar tracers of the old population
Sculptor has been proved to be a gold mine in terms of its early star formation and chemical enrichment. Tolstoy et al. (2004) show that this galaxy has two RGB population with different kinematics and metallicities, and that the spatial distribution of the red and blue HB are associated to each of these different populations. In [Martínez-Vázquez et al. (2016a)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.461L..41M/abstract), we proved that these differences are appreciable in its RR Lyrae stars (>10 Gyr). We derived the metallicity distribution of the purely old population and realized that there is a metallicity gradient (where the metal-rich RR Lyrae stars are more centrally concentrated) that happened at the first stages of the star formation of Sculptor. We compare this metallicity distribution (old population) with the RGB (age-mixed population) spectroscopic studies available in the literature. The results of this analysis suggest that star formation in the center of Sculptor lasted substantially longer than in its outer parts, thus constraining the timescales for the outside-in evolution and chemical enrichment of this galaxy.

# Crater II, the first ultra-diffuse galaxy discovered in our galaxy
Crater II is impressively large, comparable to classical dwarfs like Sculptor or Fornax, but its surface brightness is significatively small (31 mag arcsec$^{-2}$). Using DECam data, we have produced in [Walker, Martínez-Vázquez et al. (2019)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.490.4121W/abstract) the first deep color-magnitude diagram of Crater II that reaches well below the main sequence turn-off and shows that Crater II is an old system with no intermediate age or young stars. The subgiant branch clearly splits in two, showing two burst events of star-formation in its very early epochs. The isochrones indicate a mean age of 12.5 Gyr for the main event and a mean age of 10.5 Gyr for the brighter subgiant branch. With such multiple star formation events, Crater II shows similarity to more massive dwarfs that have intermediate age populations. However, for Crater II, there was early quenching of the star formation and no intermediate age or younger stars are present.

In addition, high quality light curves were obtained from the single epoch DECam data. This allowed us ([Vivas, Walker, Martínez-Vázquez et al. 2020a](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492.1061V/abstract)) to obtain accurate pulsation parameters for the RR Lyrae stars, which we used to measure a new distance for Crater II of 117 ± 4 kpc.

# Towards a complete census of RR Lyrae stars in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies
Searching for RR Lyrae stars in the ultra faint dwarf Miky Way satellites is important for obtaining accurate distances to these systems, which then allows the determination of their physical properties and the computation of their orbits. Given that ultra faint dwarf galaxies may be among the most ancient and primitive galaxies, RR Lyrae stars can provide important clues about these systems and also about the understanding of the hierarchical formation and evolution of our own Galaxy. In [Martínez-Vázquez et al. (2019)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.490.2183M/abstract) we found RR Lyrae stars in Phoenix II, Grus I, and Grus II and the new distances measured with them allowed us to set their location farther than previously thought (implying larger physical sizes). In [Vivas, Martínez-Vázquez & Walker (2020)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492.1061V/abstract), using Gaia DR2, we detected 47 RR Lyrae stars associated to 14 ultra faint dwarf galaxies, 24 RR Lyrae stars of which are newly identified as ultra faint dwarf galaxy members. 

Furthermore, from a compilation of several variability studies in classical (M$_V$ < -8 mag) and ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, in [Martínez-Vázquez et al. (2019)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.490.2183M/abstract) we inferred that there is a linear correlation between the brightness of a galaxy and the number of RR Lyrae stars in the galaxy,  which after updating the number of RR Lyrae stars in [Vivas, Martínez-Vázquez & Walker (2020)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492.1061V/abstract), has been proved to work very well even in the low luminosity regime. This relation not only foresees the number of RR Lyrae stars but also predicts that the method of finding new ultra faint dwarf galaxies by using two or more clumped RR Lyrae stars may work only for systems brighter than M $\lesssim$ -4 mag.

# Delta Scuti stars in the SMC
Delta Scuti are short period main-sequence pulsating variable stars, tracers of an intermediate-age population (1-5 Gyr). The delta Scuti population on the SMC has not been purposefully studied, and only a few, mostly serendipitous detections have been made. Using Gemini-S/GMOS time-series observations, we present in [Martínez-Vázquez, Salinas & Vivas (2020)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv201002220M/abstract) the first sizeable detection of delta Scuti stars ever made in the SMC, with 54 delta Scuti stars in the field of NGC 419, an intermediate-age globular cluster of the SMC. This allows us to estimate the density of delta Scuti in the field of the SMC for the first time ($\sim$1.6 delta Scuti/arcmin$^{-2}$). Thus, several tens of thousands of delta Scuti stars are expected to be found in the whole body of the SMC. 

Interestingly, because only a handful of the delta Scuti appear at the main sequence turnoff of the cluster NGC 419, we predict that NGC 419 is younger (t $\lesssim$ 1.2 Gyr) than previously thought.
